# chat-app-illustration

recreated a phone interface using only html and css, based on a template from Frontend Mentor.  everything besides the image of Samuel and the images of the dogs were made from scratch.  The phone size is a bit larger and has more content on the screen than a realistic phone screen, but the template was more about layout practice rather than realism.
